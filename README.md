# Ford Fulkerson and Segmented Least Squares Algorithm

In this, we have implemented the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm to find the max flow and min-cut as well as a line-fitting dynamic programming algorithm known as segmented least squares.

The ford fulkerson algorithm was tested on various test cases and was also used for solving the bipartite matching problem. Doxygen was used to create detailed reports for all the implementation, running times, analysis, etc.
